## Introduction

We've been working with several local partners in the food industry in the Louisville Metro area since March to coordinate efforts and identify issues around food accessibility and security for our citizens. We have found that as food security is a systemic issue, a single solution to attempt to affect the problem would have negligible impact. We have amassed a large network of non-profit, for-profit and community stakeholders to share knowledge of current efforts, and provide program coordination communications.

We have a hackathon scheduled right now for mid-February with a few local partners, Develop Louisville, Compassionate Louisville, Metro United Way, Humana, Dare to Care, Brown Forman and the Community Foundation, in addition to representation from U of L, Bellarmine and of course our local Code for America non-profit chapter the Civic Data Alliance. This will allow us to create a myriad of approaches to address food insecurity in our community.
