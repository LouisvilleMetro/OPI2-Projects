## Introduction

No other city is as hyper-focused on exploring the intersection between the Smart City and the Smart Home. Residents are increasingly relying on technology platforms to receive information and services and expect to access city services that are human-centered and friction-free. In order to prepare for Louisvilleâ€™s Smart City future, we are making investments in foundational infrastructure and implementing technologies through public-private partnerships.

The future of the Smart City is constantly being redefined, and by extension our relationship with citizens. The advent of the Smart Home offers an opportunity to connect with our constituents in new and exciting ways that weren't previously possible. The following projects illustrate our strategy of testing different technologies to democratize government data (preferably Open Data) and put it in useful contextual applications for our citizens.
