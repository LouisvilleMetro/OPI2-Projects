## Introduction

CNET's Urban Smart Home is a 1,400 square foot apartment that the CNET team will be filling with the latest technology to automate living spaces and connect them with data that can put them in the fast lane for the digital age. It's a natural extension of the CNET Smart Home, a suburban showcase home in Louisville that CNET owns and has been using to test and report on the latest home tech for the past couple years.

The best part of CNET's approach is that it's not focused on technology for the rich-and-famous. Instead, it's testing off-the-shelf tech that anyone can find at a local retailer and integrate into their living space.

By the same token, the City of Louisville's smart city initiatives aren't just focused on important internal stuff like making gigantic buildings more energy efficient. Rather, it has focused its efforts on things that have a direct impact on the community, such as crowdsourced air quality studies, crowdsourced bandwidth speed testing across the community, and a partnership with Waze to help manage traffic congestion with data.
