No other city is as hyper-focused on exploring the intersection between the Smart City and the Smart Home. Residents are increasingly relying on technology platforms to receive information and services and expect to access city services that are human-centered and friction-free. In order to prepare for Louisvilleâ€™s Smart City future, we are making investments in foundational infrastructure and implementing technologies through public-private partnerships.
