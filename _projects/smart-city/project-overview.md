## Introduction

No other city is as hyper-focused on exploring the intersection between the Smart City and the Smart Home. Residents are increasingly relying on technology platforms to receive information and services and expect to access city services that are human-centered and friction-free. In order to prepare for Louisville’s Smart City future, we are making investments in foundational infrastructure and implementing technologies through public-private partnerships.

The future of the Smart City is constantly being redefined, and by extension our relationship with citizens. The advent of the Smart Home offers an opportunity to connect with our constituents in new and exciting ways that weren't previously possible. The following projects illustrate our strategy of testing different technologies to democratize government data (preferably Open Data) and put it in useful contextual applications for our citizens.

The Smart City will also be a platform for Advanced Traffic Systems (ATS) and Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS), culminating in self-driving vehicles. To prepare Louisville Metro’s traffic control for the future, we are focused on data efforts.


## Inventory of projects

#### LFIT/KentuckyWired(infrastructure)

LFIT is the Louisville Metro Information Technology project and is a partnership with KentuckyWired, the Commonwealth’s project to connect all 120 counties through middle mile fiber infrastructure. This project will expand our fiber network by over 400% at a third of full costs and will both directly and indirectly improve quality of life in our community. The fiber will be used to improve (and lower the cost of) internet service for residents, support government buildings and services, and reduce the digital divide.

#### AV Drone Project (public safety)

UAS Integration Pilot Program to add UAS capability to our shooting-detection-and-location response. We are building a pilot UAS system that will automatically activate and fly (with obstacle avoidance) to specified coordinates to provide situational awareness after a gun is discharged prior to arrival of the summoned police.

#### American Printing House for the Blind, Beacon Project (infrastructure)

We have partnered with the American Printing House for the Blind to install low power, bluetooth beacons in public buildings, and map these indoor spaces for accessibility and public usage, with all data generated contributed to OpenStreetMap. It is an exciting and innovative opportunity to improve public buildings for all in our community.

#### Traffic data warehouse, with a focus on safety data, collaboration with area and state transportation organizations, including the University of Pennsylvania's Data Analytics program.

#### Amazon City on a Cloud award to build a traffic data warehouse

#### Waze CCP Processor – Open Source code collaboration to allow any city to use Waze data. Collaboration with Boston, Philly, Chicago, LA, used in Anchorage by Code for America.

#### USDOT Secure Data Commons partnership – Louisville is the development coordinator for their efforts to create a nation-wide transportation data management system for city and state govs to use.
